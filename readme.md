# Clairo - Scalable Video Transcoding Pipeline

This project implements a **video transcoding pipeline** using **FFmpeg, Apache Kafka, AWS ECS, AWS S3, and Docker**. The system is designed to process user-uploaded videos, transcode them into multiple resolutions, and store the processed versions in an S3 bucket.

## System Design

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** ‚Äì Backend server handling API requests.
- **FFmpeg** ‚Äì Video transcoding engine.
- **Apache Kafka** ‚Äì Message queue for processing uploaded videos.
- **AWS Lambda** ‚Äì Event-driven processing for metadata updates.
- **AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)** ‚Äì Runs transcoding jobs in isolated containers.
- **AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** ‚Äì Stores Docker images for transcoding.
- **AWS S3** ‚Äì Stores both raw and transcoded videos.
- **Prometheus** ‚Äì Monitoring and logging for system performance.
- **MySQL** ‚Äì Database to store video metadata.

## üìå System Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ User Uploads Video
Users upload a video via the **upload-video API endpoint** (multipart upload). The server receives the request and stores the unprocessed video in an **S3 bucket**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Metadata Storage & Event Trigger
- The server inserts a new record into **MySQL**, storing the **S3 key** and initial metadata.
- The system then triggers an **AWS Lambda function** to notify Kafka.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Kafka Producer Publishes Message
The **Kafka producer** sends a message containing:
- `S3 Bucket`
- `S3 Key` 
- `File URL`
- `Upload Timestamp`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Kafka Consumer & Transcoding
- The Kafka consumer reads the uploaded video details and spins up an **isolated Docker container** to handle transcoding.
- Each **Docker container** runs an FFmpeg-based transcoding service.
- The transcoded videos are uploaded to a different **S3 bucket**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ AWS ECS Handles Scaling
- **AWS ECS** ensures that each transcoding task runs inside a container when needed.
- The containers use a **pre-built Docker image** stored in **AWS ECR**.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Storing Processed Video Metadata
- Once the video is successfully transcoded and uploaded, the system updates the **MySQL database** with:
    - `Processed URLs` (S3 paths for the different resolutions)
    - `Available Resolutions`

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Prometheus Monitoring
- The system integrates **Prometheus** for monitoring **Kafka, ECS tasks, and transcoding performance**.
